=== Basic Compile and Test

To build the source you will need to install JDK {jdkversion}.

Spring Observability uses Maven for most build-related activities, and you
should be able to get off the ground quite quickly by cloning the
project you are interested in and typing

----
$ ./mvnw install
----

NOTE: You can also install Maven (>=3.3.3) yourself and run the `mvn` command
in place of `./mvnw` in the examples below. If you do that you also
might need to add `-P spring` if your local Maven settings do not
contain repository declarations for spring pre-release artifacts.

NOTE: Be aware that you might need to increase the amount of memory
available to Maven by setting a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with
a value like `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`. We try to cover this in
the `.mvn` configuration, so if you find you have to do it to make a
build succeed, please raise a ticket to get the settings added to
source control.

=== Mutation Tests

Spring Observability uses Pitest to perform mutation tests. To run those please execute the following command

----
$ ./mvnw clean verify -Pmutation org.pitest:pitest-maven:report-aggregate-module -U
----

=== Documentation

The spring-observability module has a "docs" profile, and if you switch
that on it will try to build asciidoc sources from
`src/main/asciidoc`. As part of that process it will look for a
`README.adoc` and process it by loading all the includes, but not
parsing or rendering it, just copying it to `${main.basedir}`
(defaults to `${basedir}`, i.e. the root of the project). If there are
any changes in the README it will then show up after a Maven build as
a modified file in the correct place. Just commit it and push the change.

=== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
https://www.springsource.com/developer/sts[Spring Tools Suite] or
https://eclipse.org[Eclipse] when working with the code. We use the
https://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs and tools
should also work without issue as long as they use Maven 3.3.3 or better.

==== Activate the Spring Maven profile
Spring Observability projects require the 'spring' Maven profile to be activated to resolve
the spring milestone and snapshot repositories. Use your preferred IDE to set this
profile to be active, or you may experience build errors.

==== Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse
We recommend the https://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] eclipse plugin when working with
eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse
marketplace".

NOTE: Older versions of m2e do not support Maven 3.3, so once the
projects are imported into Eclipse you will also need to tell
m2eclipse to use the right profile for the projects.  If you
see many different errors related to the POMs in the projects, check
that you have an up to date installation.  If you can't upgrade m2e,
add the "spring" profile to your `settings.xml`. Alternatively you can
copy the repository settings from the "spring" profile of the parent
pom into your `settings.xml`.

==== Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse
If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project metadata using the
following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.
